## Project Description/Outline
We’re looking at how today’s inflation rate compares with several aspects of everyday life.  This includes grocery prices, minimum wage, grocery purchasing habits, differences by location and a comparison of today vs. the past.
 
## Research Questions to Answer
1. How do grocery prices and minimum wages relate to Inflation?
2. How does inflation affect purchasing habits?
3. How does inflation affect gas prices and median wages?
