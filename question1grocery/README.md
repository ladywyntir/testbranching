# Inflation_MinWage_Groceries
Answer to question 1 of group 2

This file contains only one third of the final project

The question:
How does Inflation affect Minmum Wage and Grocery Prices.

# 2005-2021

The first graph we are going to look at shows average prices of commomon groceries and the average minimum wage from 2005 to 2021:

Next we are going to look at the correlation values between the consumer price index and the average minimum wage and the average prices of groceries

We fingd strong correlations in some categories in some but not all like beef, bread, and minimum wage. While the other categories, milk and eggs, have next to zero correlation to the consumer price index.

# Data for the first half of 2022

Then we compared these correlation values between the average grocery prices and the average consumer price index in the first half of 2022:

![Egg2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/182163449-35194cc1-e358-4a34-9def-9e0eefc6554b.png)

![Bread2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/182163476-9966b858-878d-45a5-ba00-9731f4412036.png)

![Milk2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/182163522-58112ea0-b8b2-4085-bf76-f236f19a9ff7.png)

We see strong correlation numbers for all our basic groceries for the first half of 2022. This is a direct contradiction to 2005-2021.

# Final Conclusion

1. While there are strong correlations between some food prices and CPI there are inconsistancies that lead us to conclude that there are more factors to consider.

2. The correlation value of .98 between minimum wage and CPI means that when the CPI goes minimum wage will be forced to follow.
