# Inflation_MinWage_Groceries
Answer to question 1 of group 2

This file contains only one third of the final project

The question:
How does Inflation affect Minmum Wage and Grocery Prices.

The first graph we are going to look at shows average prices of commomon groceries and the average minimum wage from 2005 to 2021:

Next we are going to look at the correlation values between the consumer price index and the average minimum wage and the average prices of groceries

We fingd strong correlations in some categories in some but not all like beef, bread, and minimum wage. While the other categories, milk and eggs, have next to zero correlation to the consumer price index.

Then we compared these correlation values between the average grocery prices and the average consumer price index in the first half of 2022:

![Bread2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/182163476-9966b858-878d-45a5-ba00-9731f4412036.png)

We see strong correlation numbers for all our basic groceries for the first half of 2022. While we can draw the inflation can cause rise in the price of beef and bread we cannot say the same for milk and eggs. There must be other factors causing the rise of prices.
